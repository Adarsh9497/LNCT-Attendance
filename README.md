# LNCT Attendance

Attendance has always been a headache for students. It is not just about getting back to the college in time, but also about keeping track of all the classes you've attended.

I have created an android application that helps lnct students to easily see their college attendance in a very attractive user interface, this helps you to keep track of your academic attendance in various courses. It is designed to be simple and intuitive, and is information rich. 

This application has a cool dashboard that gives you details in all categories subject-wise, date-wise and in demographic way as well.

## ⬇ Download the app from Playstore
